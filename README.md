Crime Classification in San Francisco with a focus on live model deployment. 

My focus for this project was to create a live model which serves a front end for a simple interface.The structure of the project will follow Datadriven's given cookiecutter data science <a href="https://drivendata.github.io/cookiecutter-data-science/#contributing">**link**</a>
