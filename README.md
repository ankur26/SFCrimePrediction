# SFCrimePrediction
Crime Classification in San Francisco with a focus on live model deployment. 

My focus for this project is to deploy a live model which serves a front end giving me some experience in having a live model in production.

**Libraries used**: Catboost, Pandas, Numpy


The progress of the project currently is as follows:
* Part 1: Initial Data Exploration and Feature Engineering-<a href="https://github.com/ankur26/SFCrimePrediction/blob/master/notebooks/01_data_exploration_and_feature_engineering.ipynb">**link**<a>
* Part 2: Model selection and hyperparameter optimization-<a href="https://github.com/ankur26/SFCrimePrediction/blob/master/notebooks/02_model_creation.ipynb">**link**<a> **Currently ongoing**
* Part 3: Model deployment process.
